# HTML 5 Presentation

Here's the source for the presentation I delivered on 2/22/13. 

Much of it was unprepared/off the cuff, but there's some notes here if you want
to follow along at home.

## Quick start

1. Download and load index.html in chrome.
2. View source. Read the comments.
3. Modify source.
4. Read the references included at the end of the document.
